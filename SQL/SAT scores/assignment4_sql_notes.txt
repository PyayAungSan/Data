 Also, it does not make sense of find Average since the individual columns(maths, reading and writing scores) are already averaged. So , I sum up the scores instead to make it complex. */

/*9 Found interesting function LIKE and it is very useful to group by codes such as DBN (District Borough Number), way of organizing schools and their locations by NYC Department of Education. For example, DBN such as 01M292 or anything with M refers to school in Manhattan where as code with 07X221 or ‘X’ in it refers to Bronx. You may search by tying code here
